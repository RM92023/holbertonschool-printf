.SH NAME
_printf \- formatting and printing data that were created with help of _printf
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "main.h"

int _printf(const char *format, ...);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The _printf() function writes output to stdout, the standard output stream. The output is formatted according to the format string format.
.PP
The format string may contain conversion specifications that begin with the % character. Each conversion specification is replaced with appropriate arguments from the argument list, and the resulting output is written to stdout.
.PP
The format string may also contain ordinary characters, which are written to stdout as is.
.PP
If the format string ends with a newline character ('\n'), the output is followed by a newline character. Otherwise, the output is not followed by a newline character.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The _printf() function returns the number of characters written to stdout, excluding the null byte at the end of the string. If an output error occurs, a negative value is returned.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following code snippet demonstrates the use of _printf():
.PP
.nf
#include "main.h"
int main(void)
{
    _printf("%b\n", 98);
    return (0);
}
.fi
.SH SEE ALSO
fprintf, sprintf, snprintf, printf,
.SH NOTES
The behavior of _printf() is undefined if the format string contains conversion specifications that refer to arguments beyond the number of arguments actually passed.
